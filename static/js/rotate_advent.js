Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.',
    'And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.',
